**Description:**

In schematic design the architect is charged with developing and evaluating a number of configurations bringing them into the site at a diagrammatic level. In order to accomplish this architects develop rules and constraints for ordering spaces and bringing them into a coherent whole. Furthermore the architect balances a set of values or goals that they have in the project and tries to achieve all of them. This phase is experiment, different systems are changed, rules are tweaked and compromises between values are established until they reach something acceptable. This tool automates the process of schematic design based by organizing a set of spaces onto a given site according to defined objectives through the use of computational methods, namely simulated annealing. One can then tip the scales in order to bias one objective over another based on personal values, while iteratively shifting constraints and position.

**Notes:**

This Application is a bit unfinished...

Recently I added a number of different ways in which a space evaluates and rates its position, due to the conflicting values it seems that a space rarely reaches an optimized position, so functionality is needed in which someone can weigh the importance of different values in the optimization and reduce the conflict between them
